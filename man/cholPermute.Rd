\title{Sparse Cholesky Factorisation with fill-in reducing permutations}
\usage{
cholPermute(Q, method = "spam", matlab_server = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Q}{matrix (sparse or dense), the Cholesky factor of which needs to be found}

\item{method}{If "amd", Timothy Davis SuiteSparse algorithm is used, if not that in the R Matrix package is employed}

\item{matlab_server}{A matlab server initiated using the R.matlab package by Henrik Bengtsson. Sparse Cholesky factorisation in MATLAB is generally much faster than in R.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements, Qpermchol (the permuted Cholesky factor) and P (the pivoting order matrix)
}
\description{
This function is similar to chol(A,pivot=T) when A is a sparse matrix. The fill-in reduction permutation is the approximate minimum degree permutation of
Davis' SuiteSparse package configured to be slightly more aggressive than that in the Matrix package. If the Cholesky factor fails, the matrix is coerced to be symmetric.
